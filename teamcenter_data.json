BMIDE is used to configure most of the data model along with preferences.\nThe data model is very important as it is difficult to change it once data is populated. Example Teamcenter does not allow to delete attributes if there are items using it. There could be a lot of internal references created in the database for different objects. Hence defining a good data model is crucial.\nThe data model also plays important role in performance. Not using forms and using attributes on Item revision can help in performance.
